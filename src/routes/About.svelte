      As a music teacher running a private studio during the pandemic, I found myself in a tough
      place. I decided to try my hand at my life-long love of applications by creating a tool for my
      business. I fell into the rabbit hole of coding and web development and found my new outlet

      golf, or camping. I also spend my time hanging out with my wife and dog, woodworking, baking
      bread, singing, or playing a new video game.
